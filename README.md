## Project description:

A site where a user can generate an idea for a start up with specific conditions using AI and save and access a database with previously saved ideas.

## Problem domain:

People often lack tailored, actionable startup ideas — StartUpSpark bridges this gap by generating instantly customized business concepts.

## User stories:

1. Aspiring Entrepreneur with No Idea
   As a student interested in launching a business I want to generate random startup ideas
   So that I can get inspired and explore what’s possible within my skill level.

2. Time-Constrained Professional
   As a busy working professional I want to see startup ideas based on timelines (e.g., 0–3 months)
   So that I only see business ideas that are realistic for my current schedule.

3. Low-Budget Builder
   As someone with limited financial resources I want to generate ideas that fit within a “no cost” or “under £1000” budget etc.
   So that I can explore startups I can realistically pursue.

4. Targeted Innovator
   As a user with a specific interest in health & wellness I want to enter a short description of my interest so that I receive ideas closely related to my passion.

5. Market-Driven Creator
   As someone who wants to serve Gen Z I want to filter ideas by demographics so that I get relevant concepts tailored to that market segment.

6. Curious Browser
   As a casual user I want to scroll through recent startup ideas others have generated so that I can get inspired by what’s trending or popular.
7. Decision-Maker Needing Validation
   As someone unsure about which idea to pursue what I want to see upvotes and copy ideas to my notes so that I can shortlist the best-rated concepts for further research.

## A list of any libraries, frameworks, or packages that your application requires in order to properly function:

Express, pg, cors, npm, dotenv, openai, vite

## Instructions on how to run your app:

Open the server site, open the client site, fill in the form and generate an idea and then you can copy the generated idea to your clipboard and save your idea to the database and when you scroll down you can see all the previous ideas that have been saved to the database.
